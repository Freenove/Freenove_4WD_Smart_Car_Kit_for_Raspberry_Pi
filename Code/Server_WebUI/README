# BEFORE YOU INSTALL/USE THE WebUI APP
1. Clone the Repo "Freenove_4WD_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi" 
2. Make sure you have built the car according to FNK0043 instructions: Tutorial(ordinary wheels).pdf, 
   available at the https://docs.freenove.com/projects/fnk0066/en/latest/index.html#download), 
3. You can launch successfully from the console the script "main.py located in the folder "Code/Server" (as described at page 95 of the tutorial)
4. Note the local address oy the RaspberryPi, <URL_RASP_PI> (e.g. 192.164.168.30, assigned in your local WiFi network)

# HOW TO USE THE WebUI APP
1. From the console, navigate to the folder "Code/Server_WebUI"
2. Launch the script "main_web.py"
3. On your Tablet / PC / Handy open the browser and navigate to: <URL_RASP_PI>:8080
4. the WebUI will be displayed.

# WEB-UI CONCEPT ARCHITECTURE
The FreeKap 4WD web controller is a browser-based control panel for a Raspberry Pi 4WD robot.
The main idea:

+ The browser shows the UI (video, drive pad, servos, telemetry).
+ The Raspberry Pi runs a Python HTTP server.
+ The Python server talks to the robot hardware (motors, servos, sensors, camera, buzzer).

All communication between the browser and the robot happens over HTTP (GET/POST).

# REMOVED FEATURES
- UI/CAR: Control of the Leds
- UI/CAR: Control of the Line Follower sensor

# NEW FEATURES
- UI: Use of "HOLD" + direction buttons (FWRD, REAR, RIGHT, LEFT) will hold the direction command until "STOP" is pressed
- UI: Simpler & useful telemetry data
- CAR: Automatic speed reduction based on distance from obstacle (as measured by the sonar)
- CAR: Hard brake with automatic buzzer beeping when distance to obstacle <30 cm
