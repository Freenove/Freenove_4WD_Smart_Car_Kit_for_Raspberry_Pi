Server
****************************************************************

The server works on the Raspberry Pi and can transmit camera data, ultrasonic data, etc. to the client, and it can also receive commands from the client.

In the Server folder, there is a server.py file which contains main server code. 

**get_interface_ip()** is used to get IP address of the native Raspberry Pi wlan0, without manually modifying the code to set IP parameters. 

**StartTcpServer()** is used to start the TCP service. The channel of port 5000 is mainly used to send and receive commands between the client and the server. The channel of port 8000 is used for the server to transmit the collected camera data to the client. 

**StopTcpServer()** is used to stop the TCP service. 

**sendvideo()** is used to sends the camera data.

Step 2 Run commands
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using remote desktop mode to login Raspberry Pi, you need use VNC viewer.

Enter the following command in the terminal.

1.	Use cd command to enter directory where main.py is located:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/Freenove_4WD_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/Code/Server

2.	Run main.py:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo python main.py

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Chapter_7_Smart_video_car/Chapter7_07.png
    :align: center

The interface is as below:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Chapter_7_Smart_video_car/Chapter7_07.png
    :align: center

If you don't like the interface, you can also enter the commands to open the server. It is more convenient.

1.	Use cd command to enter directory where main.py is located:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/Freenove_4WD_Smart_Car_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi/Code/Server

2.	Run main.py:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo python main.py -t -n

or Run main,py with following command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~
    $ sudo rm start.sh
    $ sudo rm .config/autostart/start.desktop

Client
****************************************************************

The client connects to the server through TCP, which receives the video stream from the server, and other commands. And it also sends commands to the server to control the car. 

Clients can run on different systems, such as windows, Linux, and so on. However, you need to install related software and libraries.

The related program is mainly in the Video.py file under the Client folder.

Part of client code is as below:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/Code/Client/Video.py
    :linenos: 
    :language: python
    :lines: 1-78
    
Run client on windows system

There are two ways to run Client on Windows.

Option 1 Running executable file directly
================================================================

Find the “Client.exe” file in the specified directory, double click it and the Client is opened.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Chapter_7_Smart_video_car/Chapter7_09.png
    :align: center

The client interface is shown as below:

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Chapter_7_Smart_video_car/Chapter7_10.png
    :align: center

After the client opens successfully, you need open the Raspberry Pi and  open server first, then enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi in the white IP edit box, and then click “Connect” to connect smart car to Raspberry Pi. After the connection is successful, you can click on the controls on the interface to operate the car.

.. note:: 
    
    :red:`when Raspberry Pi is shut down, server will be closed. You need open server again the next time.`

:red:`If pressing forward but the car moves backward, please refer to page 51 to modify the code.`

Option 2 Install python3 and some related python libraries to run the client 
================================================================

If you want to modify the client, please follow this section.

This section will be completed in your computer with windows system, not Raspberry Pi.

There are many relevant software and libraries needed to be installed in Windows system, which takes a long time. At this time, it does not need to run Server or use Raspberry Pi. You can shut down Raspberry Pi first. After the installation is completed, you need to open Raspberry Pi and server again.

Install python3
----------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting
================================================================

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/Chapter_7_Smart_video_car/Chapter7_38.png
    :align: center

**If the car works abnormally, it may be caused by following reasons: Raspberry Pi system is stuck or batteries have no power. **

You need check batteries power indicator or recharge batteries. Make sure batteries have enough power. When the batteries voltage is less than 7V, the buzzer will make regular sound.

If the batteries are OK, Raspberry Pi system is stuck. You need wait some time to check if the client works. Or reopen the server and client. 

The latest Raspberry Pi official system is not stable. It occasionally is stuck. The old version is more stable.

If the Raspberry Pi system is stuck for a long time, you need reboot Raspberry Pi.
